### Summary
Simple and intuitive 'Book Tracking App' that allows the user to browse from books from a certain library and add any desired books to the previously designated shelves, such as "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", etc.
Such process is otherwise possible to work in the reverse flow, allowing user to remove any book from any shelf.
The App also offers a 'Search' page, in which the user can search using multiple words and it will render results timely, according to each character written.
***
### Goal
The goal of this project is to test each student's ability to implement their knowledge of React.js, by creating a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that the student will use to persist information as the user interacts with the application.
It is not required to work the CSS given by default.
> Absolute goal: functionality of the App using React.js
